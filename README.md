The first course of the Data Engineer formation includes the automation procedures to provision cloud infrastructure using Terraform to manage and orchestrate.

- **Laboratory 1** - Provision of Amazon EC2 instance using Terraform
- **Laboratory 2** - Provision of Amazon EC2 instance using Terraform using:
    - *Entry variables* - definition of a variable plan to hold all necessary variables for the infrastructure
    - *Terraform Plan* - creation of the infrastructure plan, and saving it into a file
    - *Mutiple Subnets* - provision of multiple EC2 instances in different subnets
    - *Concept of Modules* - presentation of modularization concept for different infrastructure provision in a reusable form
    - *Terraform Output* - use of output files to capture variables sent by AWS after Terraform application.
